The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a comprehensive framework for addressing global challenges, 
including poverty, education, health,
 and environmental sustainability (United Nations, 2015). The alignment of technological innovations,
 particularly mobile and web applications, with these goals has emerged as a critical pathway to achieving sustainable development 
 (Kumar et al., 2020). Research indicates that integrating SDGs into application development promotes socially responsible and ethical solutions
  that address pressing global issues (Smith & Williams, 2019).
