GOALS 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations offers a framework that allows for innovative responses to the problems of global interest. Implementing the SDGs in apps creates socially conscious solutions that meet specific needs or respond to relevant problems. Their influence is maximized by the open-source development groups.

   ROLES
   Web and mobile application developers are vital to the design of solutions with social impact. Their applications have to be designed in a way that is user-centered and has ethical considerations. Playing this role encourages technical innovation that is socially conscious.
    
    AUDIENCE
    An application must be designed for the appropriate target audience in order to be successful. Targeted applications attract and engage specific demographics. Involving stakeholders ensures that the solution is exactly what the end-user needs..

    SITUATION
     Providing a real-world context for application development ensures that solutions are both relevant and impactful.
     Research underscores the importance of problem-based learning approaches in technology education, which encourage students to address authentic issues (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980)
      Applications developed with a clear understanding of the social, economic, and environmental context are more likely to succeed and make meaningful contributions to the SDGs (Sharma et al., 2020).

      PRODUCT/PERFORMANCE/OUTPUT
      Creating applications that are technically sound, socially responsible, and ethically aligned requires a multi-disciplinary approach (Preece et al., 2015).
      Studies emphasize the importance of incorporating best practices from software engineering, user experience design, and ethical computing (Brey, 2012).
      Innovative applications that leverage emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and blockchain have shown potential in addressing global challenges (Swan, 2015).
      Furthermore, research highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing solutions that extend beyond traditional computing and information technology fields (Jung & Lee, 2019).

      Objective:
Literature indicates that clearly defining the purpose of an application improves its development process and stakeholder alignment (McConnell, 2004). Applications with well-defined objectives are more likely to achieve their intended outcomes (Nielsen, 2012).

Key SDGs Targeted:
Research shows that aligning applications with specific SDGs increases their impact and relevance (UNESCO, 2020). Studies have documented successful case studies where apps contributed to SDG goals such as quality education (SDG 4) and climate action (SDG 13) (Thompson et al., 2021).

PROPOSAL ELEMENTS AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE 
Key Features:
Effective applications often include features that directly address user needs and align with SDGs (Benyon et al., 2013). For instance, educational apps may feature interactive learning modules, while healthcare apps offer real-time health monitoring (Panch et al., 2019).

Technical Architecture:
Research emphasizes the importance of clear and scalable technical architecture in application development (Bass et al., 2003). Diagrams and design models help developers visualize and communicate complex systems (Clements et al., 2010).

Research and Evidence:
A comprehensive review of literature, research papers, and external references strengthens the development process by providing evidence-based insights (Webster & Watson, 2002). Incorporating existing research ensures that applications are built on proven concepts and methodologies (Kitchenham et al., 2009).
