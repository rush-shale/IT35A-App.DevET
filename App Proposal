The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a comprehensive framework for addressing global challenges, 
including poverty, education, health,
 and environmental sustainability (United Nations, 2015). The alignment of technological innovations,
 particularly mobile and web applications, with these goals has emerged as a critical pathway to achieving sustainable development 
 (Kumar et al., 2020). Research indicates that integrating SDGs into application development promotes socially responsible and ethical solutions
  that address pressing global issues (Smith & Williams, 2019).By contributing to the open-source development community, developers can amplify
   the reach and impact of their innovations (Ghosh, 2018).

   The role of developers has evolved beyond mere technical execution to include ethical and social responsibilities (Buchanan et al., 2021).
    Mobile and web app developers are now seen as key agents in creating solutions that address societal challenges (Johnson et al., 2022).
    Recent studies highlight the importance of design thinking and human-centered design in developing applications that are both technically sound and socially impactful (Brown, 2009).
     Developers must consider user needs, accessibility, and sustainability when crafting their solutions (Martin & Lou, 2020).

     Effective application development requires a deep understanding of the target audience. Studies suggest that apps designed for specific user groups, such as farmers, communities, businesses, and governments, yield better adoption and engagement rates (Patel et al., 2019).
     For instance, applications aimed at farmers have successfully improved agricultural practices by providing real-time weather updates and market price information (AgTech Innovations, 2021).
     Engaging with stakeholders during the development process ensures that the final product addresses real-world challenges and user needs (Anderson & Miles, 2022).

     Providing a real-world context for application development ensures that solutions are both relevant and impactful.
     Research underscores the importance of problem-based learning approaches in technology education, which encourage students to address authentic issues (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980)
